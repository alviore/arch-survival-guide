## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A compatible computer or virtual machine.
- An internet connection.
- A USB drive for installation.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Download the Arch Linux ISO**: Visit the [official Arch Linux website](https://archlinux.org/download/) to download the latest ISO file.
   
2. **Create a Bootable USB**: Use tools like `Rufus` (Windows) or `dd` (Linux) to create a bootable USB drive.

3. **Boot from USB**: Restart your computer and boot from the USB drive.

4. **Set Up Your Network**: Use `iwctl` for wireless connections or `dhcpcd` for wired connections.

5. **Partition Your Disk**: Use `fdisk` or `cfdisk` to partition your disk. Create at least two partitions: one for the root and one for swap.

6. **Format the Partitions**: Format the root partition with `mkfs.ext4` and the swap partition with `mkswap`.

7. **Mount the Partitions**: Mount your root partition to `/mnt` using `mount /dev/sda1 /mnt`.

8. **Install Base Packages**: Run `pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware` to install the base system.

9. **Generate fstab**: Use `genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab` to generate the fstab file.

10. **Chroot into the New System**: Use `arch-chroot /mnt` to enter your new system.

11. **Set Time Zone**: Configure your time zone using `ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Region/City /etc/localtime` and run `hwclock --systohc`.

12. **Localization**: Edit `/etc/locale.gen` and uncomment your locale. Then run `locale-gen`.

13. **Set Hostname**: Create a hostname file using `echo "myhostname" > /etc/hostname`.

14. **Install Bootloader**: Install `GRUB` using `pacman -S grub` and configure it.

15. **Reboot**: Exit chroot and reboot your system.

For a detailed walkthrough, refer to the [official Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide).

## Configuration

Once your system is installed, you can configure it to suit your needs.

### Systemd Services

Use `systemctl` to manage services. For example, to enable a service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable service_name
```

### User Management

Create a new user with:

```bash
sudo useradd -m -G wheel username
```

Set a password with:

```bash
sudo passwd username
```

### Package Management

Arch uses `pacman` for package management. Here are some basic commands:

- **Install a package**: `sudo pacman -S package_name`
- **Remove a package**: `sudo pacman -R package_name`
- **Update the system**: `sudo pacman -Syu`

### AUR (Arch User Repository)

To install packages from the AUR, you can use an AUR helper like `yay`:

```bash
yay -S package_name
```

## Daily Maintenance

Keeping your system updated is crucial for security and performance.

### Regular Updates

Run the following command regularly to keep your system updated:

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
```

### Cleaning Up

Remove unnecessary packages with:

```bash
sudo pacman -Rns $(pacman -Qdtq)
```
